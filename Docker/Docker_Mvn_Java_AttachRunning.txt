----------------------------------- The Dockerfile that made a nice, repeatable environment.  JPT is in the local directory 'EriksApps' ------------------------------

FROM maven:3.5.0-jdk-8

RUN mkdir -p /EriksBook
WORKDIR /EriksBook

COPY ./EriksApps /EriksBook

CMD ["/bin/sh"]

---------------------------- Some notes on how to run the docker image.  Note that I skipped a few steps, this could be made more efficient with more scripting in the Dockerfile ---------------------------

- Make Dockerfile for JDK8, Maven, Eriks artifacts
- Make dockerfile:  docker build -t eriksbook .
- Run the file: docker run -it eriksbook
- Open another window:  docker exec -it "ID-of-container-from-docker-ps" bash
- Run init from one of the windows.
- Commit the changes (after the init).  docker commit (container-id-from-docker-ps) newimagename.  This will provide an image that has the maven updates applied, making a faster startup time.
- Now using 2 of the command prompts opened with 'exec', run the web app / load cycles.
